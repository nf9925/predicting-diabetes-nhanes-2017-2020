# End-to-end RStudio analysis of NHANES data to predict diabetes‚ÄîSMOTE-balanced training, multiple ML models, and performance benchmarking.

# Predictive Modeling for Diagnosing Diabetes (NHANES 2017‚ÄìMarch 2020)

This project compares classic statistical models and modern machine-learning methods to predict physician-diagnosed diabetes using pre-pandemic NHANES data. The entire workflow was built in **RStudio** for a graduate Data Mining in Healthcare course.

---

## üéØ Objective
- **Task:** Binary classification ‚Äî `DIQ010` (1 = doctor said you have diabetes, 0 = no)  
- **Goal:** Identify which modeling approach best predicts diabetes status and which predictors matter most.

---

## üì¶ Data
- **Source:** National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2017‚ÄìMarch 2020 pre-pandemic cycle (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2024).  
- **Merge key:** `SEQN`  
- **Population:** Adults ‚â• 20 years  
- **Outcome variable:** `DIQ010` (doctor-diagnosed diabetes)

### Predictor Domains (motivated by prior literature)
- **Demographic:** Age, sex, race/ethnicity, education (Andreoletti et al., 2015; Tao et al., 2022)  
- **Questionnaire:** Income, smoking status, physical activity (PaPathanasiou et al., 2013; Park & Kim, 2021)  
- **Examination:** BMI, systolic/diastolic blood pressure (Kamura et al., 2016; Hagberg et al., 1984)  
- **Laboratory:** Total cholesterol, fasting glucose, hs-CRP (Solano & Goldberg, 2006; Albosta & Bakke, 2021; Pan et al., 2017)

---

## üßº Preprocessing Pipeline
- Removed/recoded invalid or impossible codes; median imputation for selected continuous variables  
- **Handled class imbalance with SMOTE** on the training set  
- Train/test split: **70% / 30%** using `caret::createDataPartition`  
- Feature engineering (dummy variables / collapsed categories) where needed

---

## üß™ Models Compared
- **Logistic Regression** (full, reduced, interaction, male-only, etc.)  
- **Shrinkage:** LASSO, Ridge  
- **Tree-Based:** Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting (GBM), XGBoost  
- **Ensemble:** Stacked model (tree/boosting outputs fed into a logistic meta-model)

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

Across every modeling family, performance was consistently high‚Äîbut a few patterns stood out:

1. **Stacked Ensemble = Top Performer.** It achieved the lowest AIC (11.26) and perfect test metrics (Accuracy/AUC = 1.00), suggesting exceptional fit‚Äîbut also a red flag for overfitting without external validation.

2. **Shrinkage Wins on Parsimony.** LASSO delivered a perfect AUC with a dramatically lower AIC (40.37) than Ridge (99.03), indicating it trimmed noise predictors effectively while keeping signal strong.

3. **Tree-Based Models Were Also ‚ÄúToo Good.‚Äù** Decision Tree, GBM, XGBoost, and Random Forest all scored 1.00 on Accuracy/AUC, but with varying AICs (Decision Tree lowest at 20.00). Again: impressive, but suspiciously perfect.

4. **Logistic Variants Still Held Their Own.** Among traditional models, the male-only logistic model (AIC 510.48, AUC 0.973) led the pack, while simpler demographic-only specs performed poorly‚Äîconfirming richer feature sets matter.

5. **Key Predictors Recurred.** Age, BMI, fasting glucose, and select demographic variables consistently carried weight across models, aligning with prior literature on diabetes risk.

**Bottom line:** Ensemble and shrinkage techniques outperformed plain logistic regression on this dataset, but the prevalence of perfect scores means future work should focus on:
- External/temporal validation (e.g., another NHANES wave or a longitudinal cohort),
- Model calibration and interpretability (e.g., SHAP values),
- Guarding against leakage or overfitting in preprocessing.

Until then, treat these ‚Äúperfect‚Äù models as proof-of-concept, not production-ready tools.
